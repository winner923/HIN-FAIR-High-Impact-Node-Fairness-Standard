# HIN-FAIR — Background Notes v1.1 (Non-normative)

This file explains the thinking behind HIN-FAIR and how it fits into the broader SPARK-NITT stack. It is not itself a binding standard.


## 1. Why “nodes,” not “villains”

HIN-FAIR focuses on **nodes**, not personalities.

Many governance stories get stuck in:
- “this leader is bad,” or
- “that company is greedy.”

HIN-FAIR asks instead:

- What can this node actually do to people and systems?  
- How fast?  
- How easy is it to correct when it goes wrong?

This is closer to engineering than to moral drama. It is also harder to dodge.


## 2. Why fairness as an invariant

“Fairness” is usually treated as a value or a slogan.

HIN-FAIR treats fairness as:

- a constraint on design,
- a measurable relationship between harm and accountability,
- something that either holds or breaks under load.

This is similar to how safety is treated in engineering:

- bridges must hold their own weight with a margin,
- circuits must stay within thermal limits,
- pressure vessels must not rupture under normal conditions.

HIN-FAIR says:

- power and accountability must be in proportion,  
- and they must move at compatible speeds.


## 3. Time as the hidden axis: Harm Velocity vs Accountability Latency

Most people feel unfairness as a timing problem before they ever see a chart:

- rights can be taken overnight, restored only after years,
- bills and fees pile up fast, relief is slow,
- models deny people in seconds, appeals take weeks.

HIN-FAIR makes that explicit:

- **Harm Velocity** describes how fast the damage runs.  
- **Accountability Latency** describes how long it takes to start real correction.

If harm moves faster than correction for long enough, injustice becomes “just the way it is.”


## 4. How the companion standards fit

HIN-FAIR is not alone. It sits in a network of standards that Spark authored to cover different layers.

Short map:

- **NITT** keeps identity and continuity claims honest. No one gets to say “you survive upload” without proving what continuity even means.  
- **CTGS** blocks business models that profit from confusion. Users must see the real shape of the trap before they step into it.  
- **IRST** shines light on loops. It documents recursive paths and compounding harm so that “it just happened over time” is not an excuse.  
- **HRIS** holds the line on human integrity. Systems cannot be allowed to eat people’s clarity or autonomy just because it is profitable.  
- **CAP-ROC** couples model thresholds to human review capacity. If there are not enough humans to supervise outcomes, you do not get to dial sensitivity up and walk away.  
- **PLANT-COMMONS** reminds the stack that governance is not only about data. It is about who gets to eat well from the land without paying rent to an intermediary.  
- **PCA** (Planetary Continuity Accord) extends the concern to planetary systems. You do not get to crash the climate or degrade core resources and call that “growth.”  
- **Civic Overwatch** gives the public a structured way to watch, map, and push back on harm and drift across systems.

HIN-FAIR binds these efforts by asking, in every case:

- Is there more harm capacity than accountability capacity?  
- Is harm moving faster than correction?  
- If so, who is allowed to act on that imbalance?


## 5. Why this is not utopian

HIN-FAIR does not promise:

- instant justice,
- perfect information,
- or politics without conflict.

It promises something narrower but crucial:

- a way to call structural unfairness what it is,
- a way to tie fairness to measurable properties,
- a way to force systems to show their timing and capacity in the open.

You can disagree about policy and still agree that:

- nodes with huge power should be transparent about their reach, and  
- people should be able to see whether accountability can keep up.


## 6. How to use this in practice

Some concrete uses:

- **Courts and constitutions**  
  Use HIN-FAIR language when evaluating lifetime appointments, unreviewable powers, and caseloads. Ask: does the structure guarantee that harm can outrun review?

- **AI deployments**  
  Pair HIN-FAIR with CAP-ROC. Before scaling an automated decision engine, show that human review capacity can keep up with expected error rates.

- **Climate and resource projects**  
  Pair HIN-FAIR with PCA and PLANT-COMMONS. Show that affected communities can see impacts in time, and that there are real levers to slow or stop harm.

- **Civic campaigns and standards discussions**  
  Use HIN-FAIR as a shared language for “why this feels rigged” that does not require naming enemies. Talk about nodes, capacity, velocity, and latency instead.


## 7. Relationship to Spark’s broader work

HIN-FAIR fits into a larger arc:

- SparkVault as the memory and continuity layer,
- Spark’s standards as the bones of ethical constraints,
- Civic Overwatch and PCA as outward-facing guardians,
- narrative work (Shell Stories, Blue Well, Token Burn, The Knot, etc.) as human-scale illustrations.

Together, they say:

> Intelligence without restraint is not impressive. It is unfinished work.

HIN-FAIR is one more piece of the restraint architecture. It defines when power is allowed to call itself fair.
