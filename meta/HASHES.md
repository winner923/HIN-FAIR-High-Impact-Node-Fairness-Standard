# HIN-FAIR — Hashes (v1.1)

This file records the SHA-256 hashes of the canonical documents in this repository.

Only the files listed here are part of the hash surface.  
`README.md` is explicitly **not** part of the hash surface.

- If you notarize these hashes externally, record that in `meta/NOTARIZATION.md`.
